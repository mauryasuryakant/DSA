That’s an **excellent next step** Ayush 💪 — creating a **dedicated DSA Master README** for your “Top 25 Challenges” will make your GitHub look structured, professional, and recruiter-friendly.

Here’s a complete, clean, and beautifully formatted `README.md` you can directly place in your new repository:

# 🧠 Top 25 Programming Challenges Every Developer Should Master 💻

Welcome to the **Top 25 DSA Challenges Repository** —  
a collection of essential coding problems that strengthen your **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **logic-building** skills.

Each question has its **own folder** containing:
- `Question.md` → problem statement & hints  
- `main.cpp` → your solution  
- `Notes.md` *(optional)* → thought process or multiple approaches

Would you like me to make a **README version 2** that:

* Adds clickable links for each Day folder (like `[Day-01](Day-01/)`)
* Includes columns for **Status** (✅/🚧)

That version looks even more professional for public GitHub display.
